- What is fixtures-git?

It is a small library that can be used with fixtures
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fixtures) to quickly build git
repositories from a list defined in python (typically loaded from a
yaml file) to be used to test behaviour of python tools that use git.

While it's common to isolate code from other tools, given git's speed
and sometimes difficultly in being sure as to what would be the exact
behaviour, it is much more robust to use functional tests to test with
git repositories examples instead of trying to mock git's behaviour.
