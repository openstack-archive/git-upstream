    Test that importing same upstream skips unless forced

    If already on the latest upstream given, check that instead of
    duplicating the import, that instead git-upstream does nothing.

          C---D                 local/master
         /
    A---B                       upstream/master

  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [B]]
    - [D, [C]]

  branches:
    head: [master, D]
    upstream: [upstream/master, B]

  parser-args:
    - -q
    - import
    - --into=master
