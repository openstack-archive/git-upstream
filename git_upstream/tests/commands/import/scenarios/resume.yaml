    Test the --resume option to the import command

    Given a partial import, check that use of '--resume' option can pick
    up the existing import branch and complete the import as expected.

    Repository layout being checked

            C---D               local/master
           /
          /       C1            import/F
         /       /
    A---B---E---F               upstream/master


    Test that result is as follows

            C---D--------G      local/master
           /            /
          /       C1---D1       import/F
         /       /
    A---B---E---F               upstream/master
