    Test the --finish option to the import command

    Given manual intervention to resolve conflicts and complete
    the import, check that we can finish the import by manually
    requesting the merge to be performed by this tool.

    Repository layout being checked (assumed already replayed)

            C---D               local/master
           /
          /       C1---D1       import/F
         /       /
    A---B---E---F               upstream/master


    Test that result is as follows

            C---D------- G      local/master
           /            /
          /       C1---D1       import/F
         /       /
    A---B---E---F               upstream/master

    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]

    - [D, [C]]
    - [E, [B]]
    - [F, [E]]
    - [C1, [F]]
