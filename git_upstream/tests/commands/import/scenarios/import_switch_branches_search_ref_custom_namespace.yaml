    Test that the import sub-command can correctly switch branches when
    importing from upstream when given a usable search-ref.

    Repository layout being checked (assumed already replayed)

                E---F         local/master
               /
          C---D               upstream/stable
         /
    A---B---G---H             upstream/master

    New branch to be tracked will be upstream/master, so the resulting
    commits found should just be E & F.

    Test that result is as follows

                  E---F---I   local/master
                 /       /
            C---D       /     upstream/stable
           /           /
          /       E1--F1
         /       /
    A---B---G---H             upstream/master



  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [B]]
    - [D, [C]]
    - [E, [D]]
    - [F, [E]]
    - [G, [B]]
    - [H, [G]]

  # use 'custom/*' to ensure defaults are overridden correctly
  branches:
    head: [master, F]
    upstream: [custom/master, H]
    stable: [custom/stable, D]

  parser-args:
    - -q
    - import
    - --search-refs=custom/*
    - --search-refs=custom-d/*
    - --into=master
    - custom/master
