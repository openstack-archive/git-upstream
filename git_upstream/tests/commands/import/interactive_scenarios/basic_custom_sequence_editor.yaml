    Test that sequence editor is ignored for non-interactive use.

    With a simple repository, test that git-upstream ignores sequence
    editor by setting sequence editor to a command that will timeout
    (and thereby cause a test failure).

    Note in this case we need to use the interactive mode tests to
    ensure we use a subprocess call with timeouts to confirm that
    the process does not hang.

          C---D               local/master
         /
    A---B---E---F             upstream/master

  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [B]]
    - [D, [C]]
    - [E, [B]]
    - [F, [E]]

  branches:
    head: [master, D]
    upstream: [upstream/master, F]

  parser-args: [import, upstream/master]

  pre-script: |
    import os

    from git.repo import Repo


    repo = Repo(os.path.curdir)
    repo.git.config("sequence.editor", "sleep 10; echo")
