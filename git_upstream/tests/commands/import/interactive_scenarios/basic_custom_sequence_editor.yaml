    Test that sequence editor is ignored for non-interactive

    Test with a simple repository, that setting sequence editor to
    a command that will exceed a timeout, that it will be correctly
    ignored by git-upstream when using non-interactive mode.

    Note in this case we need to use the interactive mode tests to
    ensure we use a subprocess call with timeouts to confirm that
    the process does not hang.

          C---D               local/master
         /
    A---B---E---F             upstream/master

  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [B]]
    - [D, [C]]
    - [E, [B]]
    - [F, [E]]

  branches:
    head: [master, D]
    upstream: [upstream/master, F]

  parser-args: [import, upstream/master]

  pre-script: |
    git config sequence.editor "sleep 10 && cat"
