    Test the --no-merge option to the import command (interactive)

    Given manual intervention to resolve conflicts and complete
    the import, check that if originally given --no-merge, that
    correctly reach the end of the rebase and skip performing the
    final merge.

    Repository layout being checked (assumed already replayed)

          C---D                 local/master
         /
    A---B---E---F               custom/master


    Test that result is as follows

            C---D               local/master
           /
          /       C1---D1       import/F
