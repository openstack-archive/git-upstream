    Test if searcher handles simple cherry picks

    Checks that importing an upstream where all local changes have
    gone upstream, will spot that the commits are identical using
    cherry-pick mechanism of git rev-list.

          C---D                 local/master
         /
    A---B---E---C1--D1          upstream/master

  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [B]]
    - [D, [C]]
    - [C1, [E]]
    - [D1, [C1]]
    - [E, [B]]

  branches:
    head: [master, D]
    upstream: [upstream/master, D1]

  expected_changes: []
