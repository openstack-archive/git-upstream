    Repository layout being tested

      B-------E---F---G                 master
     /       /
    A---C---D---H---I                   upstream/master


  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [A]]
    - [D, [C]]
    - [E, [D, B]]
    - [F, [E]]
    - [G, [F]]
    - [H, [D]]
    - [I, [H]]

  branches:
    head: [master, G]
    upstream: [upstream/master, I]
