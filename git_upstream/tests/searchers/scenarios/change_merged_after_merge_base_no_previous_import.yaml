    Construct a repo layout using a complex layout where the first merge
    commit was started before local diverged from upstream and merged
    subsequently. Ensure this is not confused with the old style merge
    of an additional branch, which would exclude everything behind the
    merge.


    Repository layout being tested

      B-------E---F---G                 master
     /       /
    A---C---D---H---I                   upstream/master


  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [A]]
    - [D, [C]]
    - [E, [D, B]]
    - [F, [E]]
    - [G, [F]]
    - [H, [D]]
    - [I, [H]]

  branches:
    head: [master, G]
    upstream: [upstream/master, I]

  expected-changes: [B, E, F, G]
