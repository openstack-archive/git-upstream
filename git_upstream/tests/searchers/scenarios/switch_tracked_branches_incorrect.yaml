    Construct a repository layout where the upstream branch is switched
    after an initial import, from 'upstream/stable' to 'upstream/master'.
    Test that using the new branch as the search pattern forces changes
    from 'upstream/stable' to be included. This is in contrast to the
    test in `switch_tracked_branches`.

    This shows the additional changes that are picked up.
