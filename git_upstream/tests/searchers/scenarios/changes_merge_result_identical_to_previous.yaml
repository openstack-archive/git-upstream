    Construct a repo layout where using a complex layout involving
    additional branches having been included, and a previous import
    from upstream having been completed, test that if the previous
    import resulted in the same contents of the tree after merge as
    was there before that we can still correctly find the previous
    import point.

    Repository layout being tested

          B---C---D---G---I---J---K     master
         /             \     /

       /                   /
      /       B1--C1--D1-G1             import/next
     /       /
    A---E---F---L---M                   upstream/master

  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
