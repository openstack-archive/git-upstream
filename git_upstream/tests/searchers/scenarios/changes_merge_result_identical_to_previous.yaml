    Construct a repo layout where using a complex layout involving additional
    branches having been included, and a previous import from upstream having
    been completed, test that if the previous import resulted in the same
    contents of the tree after merge as was there before that we can still
    correctly find the previous import point.

    Repository layout being tested

          B---C---D---G---I---J---K     master
         /             \     /
        /               ----H
       /                   /
      /       B1--C1--D1-G1             import/next
     /       /
    A---E---F---L---M                   upstream/master

  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [B]]
    - [D, [C]]
    - [E, [A]]
    - [F, [E]]
    - [G, [D]]
    - [B1, [F]]
    - [C1, [B1]]
    - [D1, [C1]]
    - [G1, [D1]]
    - [H, [G, =G1]]
    - [I, [G]]
    - [J, [=I, H]]
    - [K, [J]]
    - [L, [F]]
    - [M, [L]]

  branches:
    head: [master, K]
    upstream: [upstream/master, M]

  expected-changes: [B1, C1, D1, G1, H, I, J, K]
