    Test cherry-picked changes found with complex layout

    Construct a repo layout where using a complex layout involving additional
    branches having been included, and a previous import from upstream having
    been completed, test that cherry-picked changes are correctly spotted
    having been upstreamed and removed from the set to be rebased.
