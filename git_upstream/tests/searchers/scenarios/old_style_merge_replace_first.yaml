    Construct a repo layout using an old approach where the mainline would
    be replaced with the upstream and then local changes replayed on top.
    Check to see if we can correctly convert from this approach.

    Repository layout being tested

      B-----------G                     packaging
       \           \
        C---D---E---H--D1--E1           master
       /           /
      /           /
     /           /
    A---F-----------I---J               upstream/master

  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, []]
    - [C, [A, B]]
    - [D, [C]]
    - [E, [D]]
    - [F, [A]]
    - [G, [B]]
    - [H, [E, =F, =G]]
    - [D1, [H]]
    - [E1, [D1]]
    - [I, [F]]
    - [J, [I]]

  branches:
    head: [master, E1]
    upstream: [upstream/master, I]
    packaging: [packaging, B]

  expected-changes: [H, D1, E1]
