    Construct a repo layout where using a complex layout where no
    previous import from upstream having been completed, test that if a
    change has been explicitly merged (common with GitHub PR's) without
    it being necessary, then the searcher will correct include the
    change and not detect it as a possible import merge

    will the searcher correctly include 'O' below even though there was
    no need for a merge 'D' to be created.

    Repository layout being tested

            O
           / \
      B---C---D---G                     master
     /
    A---E---F---L---M                   upstream/master


  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [B]]
    - [O, [C]]
    - [D, [C, =O]]
    - [E, [A]]
    - [F, [E]]
    - [G, [D]]
    - [L, [F]]
    - [M, [L]]

  branches:
    head: [master, G]
    upstream: [upstream/master, M]

  expected-changes: [B, C, O, D, G]
