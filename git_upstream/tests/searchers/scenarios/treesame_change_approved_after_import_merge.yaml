    Construct a repo layout where using a complex layout where a previous
    import from upstream having been completed, test that if a change was
    created on before the previous import was created, and merged to the
    target branch 'but did not introduce any changes to the branch' that
    it is not incorrectly detected as the previous merge import.

    i.e. will the searcher ignore 'I' even though it is treesame to 'H',
    and instead correctly detect 'H' as the previous import given the
    diagram below. Additionally will it exclude 'O' as not contributing
    anything to the final state.
