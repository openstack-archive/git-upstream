    Using a complex repo layout containing a previous import from upstream,
    test a change that was created from the target branch before the previous
    import but only merged after the import, and furthermore did not introduce
    any changes to the branch. It should not be incorrectly detected as the
    previous import merge.

    i.e. will the searcher ignore 'I' even though it is treesame to 'H',
    and instead correctly detect 'H' as the previous import given the
    diagram below. Additionally will it exclude 'O' as not contributing
    anything to the final state.
