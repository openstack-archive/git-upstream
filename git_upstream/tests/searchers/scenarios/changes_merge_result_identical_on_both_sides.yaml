    Construct a repo layout where using a complex layout involving
    additional branches having been included, and a previous import
    from upstream having been completed, test that if the previous
    import resulted in the same commits and tree contents on both
    sides, that the tool can still correctly find the previous import
    point.

    Repository layout being tested

          B---C---D---G---H---I---J     master
         /               /
        /               G1              import/next
       /               /
      /       B1--C1--D1
     /       /
    A---E---F---K---L                   upstream/master

  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [B]]

  branches:
