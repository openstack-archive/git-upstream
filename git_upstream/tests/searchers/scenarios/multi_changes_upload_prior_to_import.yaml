    Construct a repo layout where using a complex layout involving
    additional branches having been included, and a previous import
    from upstream having been completed, test that if a change was
    created on another branch before the previous import was created,
    and merged to the target branch after the previous import, can we
    find it correctly.
    i.e. will the strategy also include commit 'O' in the diagram
    below.
