    Construct a repo layout where using a complex layout involving an additional
    branch having been included, and a previous import from upstream completed
    completed, test that if multiple changes were created on the mainline branch
    before the previous import was created, and merged to the target branch
    after the previous import, that we can find them correctly.

    i.e. will the strategy also include commits 'L' and 'J' from the diagram.

    Repository layout being tested
