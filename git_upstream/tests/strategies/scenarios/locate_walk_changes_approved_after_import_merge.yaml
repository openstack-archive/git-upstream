    Construct a repo layout where using a complex layout involving
    additional branches having been included, and a previous import from
    upstream having been completed, test that if a change was created on
    another branch before the previous import was created, and merged to
    the target branch before the previous import was merged, can we find
    it correctly. That is to say: will the strategy also include commit
    'O' in the diagram below.

    Repository layout being tested

                O----
               /     \
          B---C---D---H---I---J---K     master
         /         \     /
        /           ----G
       /               /
      /       B1--C1--D1                import/next
     /       /
    A---E---F---L---M                   upstream/master

  tree:
    - [A, []]
    - [B, [A]]
    - [C, [B]]
    - [D, [C]]
    - [E, [A]]
    - [F, [E]]
    - [B1, [F]]
    - [C1, [B1]]
    - [D1, [C1]]
    - [G, [D, =D1]]
    - [O, [C]]
    - [H, [D, O]]
    - [I, [H, G]]
    - [J, [I]]
    - [K, [J]]
    - [L, [F]]
    - [M, [L]]

  branches:
    head: [master, K]
    upstream: [upstream/master, M]

  expected-changes: [B1, C1, D1, O, J, K]
