What is git-upstream?
=====================

git-upstream is an open source Python application that can be used to
keep in sync with upstream open source projects, mainly OpenStack.

The main usecase for this tool is for people who are doing active
contributions to repositories that are mirrors of OpenStack
repositories, with the intention that most of those contributions will
be submitted to review.openstack.org at some point. If you are running a
public cloud based on OpenStack, having local changes needed to use it
in your environment, you can use git-upstream to stay up to date with
the upstream master in a easier way (with respect to using raw git
commands).

git-upstream provides new git subcommands to support rebasing of
local-carried patches on top of upstream repositories. It provides
commands to ease the use of git for who needs to integrate big upstream
projects in their environment. The operations are performed using Git
commands.

.. note:: currently git-upstream can be used only for projects that are
   maintained with Gerrit as it relies on the presence of Change-IDs.
   Nevertheless, the code is quite modular and can be extended to use
   any part of commit message (e.g., other headers).


Current git-upstream version supports the following features

-  **Single upstream branch import**

Your repository is tracking an upstream project and has local changes
applied and no other branch is merged in. This can also be applied to
tracking upstream packaging branches: *e.g.*, ubuntu/master =>
ubuntu/saucy-proposed/nova + local packaging changes.

-  **Multi branch import (upstream branch + additional branches)**

In this case, your project tracks an upstream repository, merges in an
arbitrary number of branches and applies local carried changes.

-  **Re-reviewing**

Reviewing (w/ Gerrit) of all locally applied changes if desired.
git-upstream creates an import branch in a manner that allows it to be
fully re-reviewed or merged into master and pushed.

-  **Detailed logging**

git-upstream can output to both console and log file simultaneously.
Multiple levels and these are managed separately for log file and
console output. This means jobs run by Jenkins can save a detailed log
file separately as an artefact while printing status information to the
console if those running the jobs don’t wish to have the console spammed
with the details.

-  **Dropping of changes that appear upstream**

Compares Change-Id's of changes applied since previous import with those
that have appeared on the upstream branch since the last import point.

-  **Interactive mode**

Once the list of changes to be re-applied has been determined (and those
to be dropped have been pruned), the tool can open an editor (controlled
by your git editor settings) for users to review those changes to be
made and allow them to perform further operations such as re-ordering,
dropping of obsolete changes, squashing.

-  **Dropping local changes**

It’s always possible for local changes to be superseded by upstream
changes, so when these are identified and marked as such, we should drop
them.

This can also occur where a change was applied locally, modified when
being upstreamed based on review feedback and the resulting differences
were ported to the internal as well. While the original change will be
automatically dropped, also useful to drop the additional ported changes
automatically if possible, rather than have it cause conflicts.

What git-upstream is not
========================

The name of this tool includes the "git-" prefix because of the Git
naming convention that a Git subcommand must have. So, as git-review
(usually invoked with "git review [...]"), this tool can be invoked
using "git upstream [...]".

That said, and even if git-upstream currently uses Change-Ids, it is not
strictly related to git-review. In other words, git-review can (and most
of the time will) be used without even knowing about git-upstream
existence.

git-upstream installation
=========================

At the time of writing, there are two ways to install git-upstream:
cloning its git repository or using pip.

Installing from git repository
------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/git-upstream.git
    cd git-upstream
    # Install git-upstream itself
    python setup.py install

Installing from PyPI
--------------------

.. code:: bash

    pip install git-upstream

Using git-upstream
==================

Please see ``USAGE.md``

Available commands
==================

import
------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Import code from specified upstream branch. Creates an import branch
from the specified upstream branch, and optionally merges additional
branches given as arguments. Current branch, unless overridden by the
``--into`` option, is used as the target branch from which a list of
changes to apply onto the new import is constructed based on the
specified strategy. Once complete it will merge and replace the contents
of the target branch with those from the import branch, unless
``--no-merge`` is specified.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    git upstream import [-h] [-d] [-i] [-f] [--merge] [--no-merge]
                               [-s <strategy>] [--into <branch>]
                               [--import-branch <import-branch>]
                               [<upstream-branch>] [<branches> [<branches> ...]]

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

::

    positional arguments:
      <upstream-branch>     Upstream branch to import. Must be specified if you
                            wish to provide additional branches.
      <branches>            Branches to additionally merge into the import branch
                            using default git merging behaviour

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -d, --dry-run         Only print out the list of commits that would be
                            applied.
      -i, --interactive     Let the user edit the list of commits before applying.
      -f, --force           Force overwrite of existing import branch if it
                            exists.
      --merge               Merge the resulting import branch into the target
                            branch once complete
      --no-merge            Disable merge of the resulting import branch
      -s <strategy>, --strategy <strategy>
                            Use the given strategy to re-apply locally carried
                            changes to the import branch. (default: drop)
      --into <branch>       Branch to take changes from, and replace with imported
                            branch.
      --import-branch <import-branch>
                            Name of import branch to use

drop
----

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Mark a commit as dropped. Marked commits will be skipped during the
upstream rebasing process.

See also the "git upstream import" command.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    git upstream drop [-h] [-a <author>] <commit>

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

::

    positional arguments:
      <commit>              Commit to be marked as dropped

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -a <author>, --author <author>
                            Git author for the mark

Note
~~~~

Commits will be marked with git notes in the namespace
``refs/notes/upstream-merge``.

To list of commit id marked with a note, run
``git notes --ref refs/notes/upstream-merge``.

To show a specific note run
``git notes --ref refs/notes/upstream-merge show <marked commit sha1>``

As ``drop`` uses git notes to mark commits that have to be skipped
during import, notes should be present on the cloned copy of your
repository. Thus, if you are going to create notes on a system and
perform the actual import on a different system, **notes must be present
on the latter**.

You can push notes directly to git repository on the target system or
push them in a different repository and then pull notes from your target
system.

supersede
---------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Mark a commit as superseded by a set of change-ids. Marked commits will
be skipped during the upstream rebasing process **only if all the
specified change-ids are present in ``<upstream-branch>`` during
import**. If you want to unconditionally drop a commit, use the ``drop``
command instead.

See also the "git upstream import" command.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    git upstream supersede [-h] [-f] [-u <upstream-branch>]
                           <commit> <change id> [<change id> ...]

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

::

    positional arguments:
      <commit>              Commit to be marked as superseded
      <change id>           Change id which makes <commit> obsolete. The change id
                            must be present in <upstream-branch> to drop <commit>.
                            If more than one change id is specified, all must be
                            present in <upstream-branch> to drop <commit>

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f, --force           Apply the commit mark even if one or more change ids
                            could not be found. Use this flag carefully as commits
                            will not be dropped during import command execution as
                            long as all associated change ids are present in the
                            local copy of the upstream branch
      -u <upstream-branch>, --upstream-branch <upstream-branch>
                            Search change ids values in <upstream-branch> branch
                            (default: upstream/master)

Note
~~~~

*This command doesn't perform the actual drop*. Commits to be dropped
during the next import, will be marked with git notes in the namespace
``refs/notes/upstream-merge``. There is no need to retain notes after an
import dropped the correspondent commits, of course it doesn't harm
keeping them either.

To list of commit id marked with a note, run
``git notes --ref refs/notes/upstream-merge``.

To show a specific note run
``git notes --ref refs/notes/upstream-merge show <marked commit sha1>``.

As ``supersede`` uses git notes to mark commits that have to be skipped
during import, notes should be present on the cloned copy of your
repository. Thus, if you are going to create notes on a system and
perform the actual import on a different system, **notes must be present
on the latter**. You can push notes directly to git repository on the
target system or push them in a different repository and then pull notes
from your target system.

Thanks to *Aleksander Korzynski* and *Stanisław Pitucha* for taking the
original design spec and some basic manual steps and experimenting with
initial implementations.

To *Davide Guerri*, for picking up a rough python tool and turning it
into something that was actually usable.

Also to *Jon Paul Sullivan* and *Monty Taylor* to listening and
providing a sounding board for different approaches.

And finally to *Coleman Corrigan* among numerous others who acted as
willing guinea pigs for the original manual approach.
